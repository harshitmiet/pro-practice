## Note:
* I will add questions according to topics, and also share my solution. Most of my solutions will be in c++ (Preffered for Pro).  <br> If you need a solution in java or another language just message me on whatsapp or add a Issue in github repository.
* If you want to learn some additional concept or topic, inform me. I will add it to extras and questions related to it.
